## Five coding problems incorporating current knowledge

1️⃣ Student Info Collector ✅
1. Ask the user: “How many students are there?”
    Store that number as numStudents.
2. Create an empty ArrayList to hold student names.
3. Use a for loop that runs numStudents times:
    Each loop, prompt the user: “Enter student name:”
    Add that name to the ArrayList.
4. After collecting all names, use another loop to go through the ArrayList:
    Print each name with "Student: " in front.
    Example output: Student: Charles

2️⃣ Array Sum & Average ✅
- Ask the user for 5 numbers
- Store them in an array of integers
- Use a for loop to sum them
- Calculate and print the average

3️⃣ 2D Grid Printer ✅
- Create a 2D array (3 rows x 4 columns)
- Fill each element with "RowX-ColY" using nested for loops
- Use row and column traversal to print the grid

4️⃣ Reverse String with While Loop ✅
- Ask the user for a word
- Use a while loop to reverse the string manually (character by character)
- Print the reversed word

5️⃣ Number Filter with ArrayList ✅
- Ask the user for 10 numbers
- Add all numbers to an ArrayList
- Use a for loop to traverse and keep only numbers greater than 50 in a new ArrayList
- Print the filtered list
