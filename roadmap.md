✅ Your Current Strengths
You’re comfortable with:
- Loops (for, while, nested)
- 1D and 2D arrays
- ArrayLists
- Basic string operations
- Simple user interaction
- Primitives and simple objects

🚀 Roadmap

1️⃣ Solidify Control Flow Patterns
Why? So you can handle more real-world scenarios with your current tools
✔️ Practice:
- More pattern problems: diagonal, spiral, or zig-zag traversal of 2D arrays.
- Classic mini-games: Tic-Tac-Toe board validation.
- Simple menu-driven console apps using while loops.

2️⃣ Master Linked Lists
Why? They build your understanding of dynamic data structures and how references work.
✔️ Learn:
- Singly linked list: insert, delete, traverse.
- Doubly linked list: backward traversal.
- Write from scratch — no built-in classes!

3️⃣ Stacks & Queues
Why? These strengthen your abstraction skills. You already know arrays and ArrayLists — now you see how to limit operations to model real-world problems.
✔️ Learn:
- Implement stack with ArrayList or linked list.
- Implement queue the same way.
- Solve real tasks: reverse a string, check balanced parentheses, process tasks in order.

4️⃣ Recursion
Why? It unlocks trees, graphs, and backtracking.
✔️ Start with:
- Factorial.
- Fibonacci.
- Reverse a string.
- Sum digits of a number.
- Visualize call stacks!

5️⃣ Trees
Why? Trees build non-linear thinking and prepare you for searching and sorting.
✔️ Learn:
- Basic binary tree: insert, find.
- Traversals: preorder, inorder, postorder.
- Simple practice: invert a binary tree, check if two trees are identical.

6️⃣ HashMaps & Sets
Why? You’ll see how hashing speeds up searching and how to prevent duplicates.
✔️ Learn:
- Frequency counting (most common word).
- Detect duplicates.
- Group data by key.

7️⃣ Basic Algorithms & Big O
Why? To start thinking about performance.
✔️ Focus on:
- Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion (classic beginner sort algorithms).
- Searching: Linear vs. Binary search.
- Time/space complexity basics.

✅ Putting It All Together
Concepts/Practice Ideas:
Advanced loops, pattern printing - Spiral/diagonal matrix, mini-games, user menus
Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues	Implement from scratch, small real problems
Recursion - Factorial, Fibonacci, reverse, sum digits
Trees, Binary Trees, BST - Traversals, invert, find min/max, height
HashMaps, Sets - Word count, frequency map, duplicates removal
Big O & Algorithms - Sorting, Searching, Practice comparing efficiency, sort arrays manually

🎯 How to Use This
Pick one chunk.
Build it from scratch — don’t just use built-ins.
Solve 2–3 simple practice problems for each.
Focus on why you’d choose one structure over another.
